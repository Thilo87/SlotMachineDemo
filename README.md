A simple slot machine project made with UE5. Contains all the base classes needed for making more complex slot machines and one exemplary graphical slot machine.

Features:
- slot machine base classes separated from the user interface
- line, bet size, payout and elements selection
- simulation of the expected value (the contained slot machine has an EV of about 0.9)
- exemplary graphical slot machine "pirate slots"
